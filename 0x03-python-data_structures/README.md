Requirements
---------------------------------------------------
Python Scripts
-------------------------------------------------------------
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using
python3 (version 3.4.3)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
----------------------------------------------
C
------------------------------------------------------------
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using
the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
All your files should end with a new line
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using
betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples.
You can use them to test your functions,
but you don’t have to push them to your repo
(if you do we won’t take them into account).
We will use our own main.c files at compilation.
Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be include
d in your header file called lists.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
